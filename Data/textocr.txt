e Steelhead baseline — In collaboration with seven other Columbia River basin
and West Coast laboratories we have initiated the Stevan Phelps Allele Nomencla-
ture (SPAN) project, an inter-agency effort to create a shared, standardized genetic
baseline for steelhead (and rainbow trout). Our current focus is the Columbia River,
but progress is being made for Pacific Rim coverage within a few years.

e Single nucleotide polymorphism baselines - Our program has developed
SNP markers in Pacific salmon for over 15 years. We have a forensic SNP base-
line for identifying Endangered Spring-Run Chinook salmon in the Upper Co-
lumbia River, and we are participating in a collaboration to augment the GAPS
coastwide Chinook microsatellite baseline with standardized SNP markers.

The NWESC is also using GSI in multiple ecological and forensic applications, including:

e Oregon/Klamath fisheries project — We are collaborating with Oregon State
University and the Oregon fishery industry (CROOS) on a pilot project to use
GSI to evaluate Klamath fall Chinook distributions off the Oregon coast.

For mor | information e Studies of salmon ocean distribution —- We have several ongoing GSI
0 . ore GS ° alo projects in collaboration with NWFSC, SWFSC and OSU scientists to study the
Dr. Michael Ford, Director ocean distributions of juvenile salmon, including coho and Chinook salmon off the

Conser vation Biology D Ivison California, Oregon and Washington coasts and in the Columbia River plume and
Northwest Fisheries Science Center estuary.

2725 Montlake Blvd. East ee
Seattle, WA 98112 e Studies of Puget Sound distribution — We have an ongoing study in col-

706-860-5612 laboration with other NWESC investigators to study the early marine distribu-
tions of juvenile Chinook salmon.

e Forensics and prey studies — We use GSI to identify the stock origin of indi-
vidual fish of interest for forensic applications in collaboration with the NOAA
Office of Law Enforcement, as well as genetic identification of harbor seal and
killer whale prey remains.

e In-river studies — We have several recent or ongoing GSI studies of temporal
distributions of migrating stocks, including Columbia River steelhead, Willa-
mette River Chinook, and White River (Puget Sound) Chinook.
